@par Example Description 

The USB Device Dual Core example uses the STM32F207xx, STM32F429xx and STM32F407xx multi core support
feature and integrates the Mass Storage and HID examples in the same project. 
The Mass storage device should be connected to the USB HS port while the HID device 
should be connected to the FS port. 
           
  @note The USB Device library uses the multi-packet feature, this functionality increase 
        the transfer performance when using big amount of data. In   the Mass storage demo, 
        an intermediary buffer is used to receive/send data from/to USB  and used also to 
        write/read from the physical media (microSD). The bigger is the buffer, the faster
        is the IO operations in USB and also in media; in order to use a balanced buffer size
        with the project footprint; the buffer size was defined in the usbd_conf.h file to 4K,
        but it can be modified by the user from 512 Bytes to 64KBytes.
        

@par Hardware and Software environment 

   - This example has been tested STM322xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F207xx), STM324xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F407xx) and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx)
   
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use both CN8 and CN9 connectors to connect the board to a PC host
    - Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN6 connector
          - STM322xG-EVAL RevA: make sure that Jumper JP22 is in position 1<->2
          - STM322xG-EVAL RevB: make sure that Jumpers JP22 and JP16 are in position 1<->2
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use both CN8 and CN9 connectors to connect the board to a PC host
    - Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN6 connector, and Jumpers
      JP22 & JP16 are in position 1<->2
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN14 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
    - Use CN15  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral
      Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM324x9I-EVAL Evaluation Board 
              User Manual.
        @note Make sure that :
         - Please ensure that jumper JP16 is not fitted when using USB OTG FS
  
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-FS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS-IN-FS: to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral

  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application
	
@note Known Limitations
      - This example retarget the C library printf() function to the EVAL board’s LCD
      screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
      messages. TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be displayed
      on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in bottom of
      the LCD). To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
