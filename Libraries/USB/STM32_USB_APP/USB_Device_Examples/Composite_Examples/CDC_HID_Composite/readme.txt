@par Example Description 

The examples provide a composite device.
A composite device is one that has multiple interfaces controlled independently of each other.
Using composite device, multiple functions are combined into a single device.
In this Example the independent interfaces are : HID and VCP (CDC).

The implementation of the composite CDC-HID device is done by creating a wrapping
class (see folder hid_cdc_wrapper ) that makes calls to the separate CDC and HID class layer
handlers (files usb_cdc_core.c and usb_hid_core.c files).

To test the demo, you can run HID mouse example and in same time you can
do a USB to USART communication by opening a serial terminal window (like hyperterminal)
and selecting the STM32 virtual comport (you need to follow same steps as  the CDC virtual comport example).
   
To run this example, you will need to modify the following lines in the .inf file of the cdc driver:
stmcdc.inf (you will find it in "C:\Program Files\STMicroelectronics\Software\Virtual COM Port Driver).
 
The stmcdc.inf exists to assist in the loading of the proper USB serial drivers in the Windows OSs for 
the composite device to operate correctly as a virtual COM interface.

The following Lines associates the CDC device with the OS’s usbser.sys driver file 
and causes the OS to load this driver during the enumeration process.

The "MI" stands for Multiple Interface.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

- This example has been tested with STM3210C-EVAL RevB (STM32F107xx devices), STM322xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F207xx), 
	STM324xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F407xx) and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx) 
   
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use CN2 connector to connect the board to host
	- Use CN6 connector to connect the board to PC over RS232 (USART) serial cable.
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that Jumper JP16 is connected in position 2-3
		 
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral 
	- Use CN9 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral 
	- Use CN16 connector to connect the board to PC over RS232 (USART) serial cable. 
        @note Make sure that :                                                                                     
		 - Please ensure that Jumper JP22 is connected in position 1-2
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral 
	- Use CN9 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral 
	- Use CN16 connector to connect the board to PC over RS232 (USART) serial cable. 
		@note Make sure that :
         - Please ensure that Jumper JP22 is connected in position 1-2
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN14 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
    - Use CN15  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral
	- Use CN8 connector to connect the board to PC over RS232 (USART) serial cable
      Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM324x9I-EVAL Evaluation Board 
              User Manual.
        @note Make sure that :
         - Please ensure that jumper JP16 is not fitted when using USB OTG FS
		 - Please ensure that Jumper JP7 is connected in position 1-2
		 
@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-FS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS-IN-FS: to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral

    - STM3210C-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F107xx devices  
  
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application

@note Known Limitations
      - This example retarget the C library printf() function to the EVAL board’s LCD
      screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
      messages. TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be displayed
      on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in bottom of
      the LCD). To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
