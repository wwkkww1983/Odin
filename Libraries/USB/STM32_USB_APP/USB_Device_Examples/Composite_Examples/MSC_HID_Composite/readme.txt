@par Example Description 

The examples provide a composite device.
A composite device is one that has multiple interfaces controlled independently of each other.
Using composite device, multiple functions are combined into a single device.
In this Example the independent interfaces are : Mass Storage (MSC) and (HID).

This Example was created by combining the code in the usbd_hid (HID) and usbd_msc (mass storage)

The implementation of the composite HID-MSC device is done by creating a wrapping
class (see folder msc_hid_wrapper ) that makes calls to the separate HID and MSC class layer
handlers (files usbd_hid_core.c and usb_msc_core.c files).

To test the demo, you can access to SDcard content and in same time you can run HID mouse demo.

When even one of the interface class of the device is changed, it should be handled
differently by Windows. However, it doesn't recognize the modification. To avoid conflict on
Windows, we suggest to assign another VID/PID to the device or delete device instance from device manager.  

@par Hardware and Software environment 

- This example has been tested with STM3210C-EVAL RevB (STM32F107xx devices), STM322xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F207xx), 
	STM324xG-EVAL RevB (STM32F407xx) and STM324x9I-EVAL RevB (STM32F429xx) 
   
  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use CN2 connector to connect the board to host
	_ Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN16 connector
	
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral 
	- Use CN9 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral 
	- Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN6 connector
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN8 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral 
	- Use CN9 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral 
	- Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN6 connector
		@note Make sure that :
		 - Please ensure that jumper JP31 is fitted when using USB OTG HS 
		 
  - STM324x9I-EVAL Set-up
    - Use CN14 connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG FS peripheral
    - Use CN9  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS peripheral
    - Use CN15  connector to connect the board to host when using USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral
	- Make sure that a microSD card is plugged into CN17 connector
      Note that some FS signals are shared with the HS ULPI bus, so some PCB rework is needed.
              For more details, refer to section "USB OTG2 HS & FS" in STM324x9I-EVAL Evaluation Board 
              User Manual.
        @note Make sure that :
         - Please ensure that jumper JP16 is not fitted when using USB OTG FS

@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
  - Open your preferred toolchain
  - In the workspace toolbar select the project config:
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM322xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F207xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-HS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324xG-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F407xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral

    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-FS:to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG FS peripheral
    - STM324x9i-EVAL_USBD-HS-IN-FS: to configure the project for STM32F429xx devices and use USB OTG HS-IN-FS peripheral

    - STM3210C-EVAL_USBD-FS: to configure the project for STM32F107xx devices  
  
  - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
  - Run the application

@note Known Limitations
      - This example retarget the C library printf() function to the EVAL board’s LCD
      screen (C library I/O redirected to LCD) to display some Library and user debug
      messages. TrueSTUDIO Lite version does not support I/O redirection, and instead
      have do-nothing stubs compiled into the C runtime library. 
      As consequence, when using this toolchain no debug messages will be displayed
      on the LCD (only some control messages in green will be displayed in bottom of
      the LCD). To use printf() with TrueSTUDIO Professional version, just include the
      TrueSTUDIO Minimal System calls file "syscalls.c" provided within the toolchain.
      It contains additional code to support printf() redirection.
